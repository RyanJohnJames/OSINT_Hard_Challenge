# OSINT_Hard_Challenge
Outsourced because tofu.boi thought it was a great idea to solo the whole OSINT category.

>[!Caution]
># I QUIT

## Idea:
To make them figure out where I copied this code from, fix it based on the code they found.

## Updates:

**25/10/25** - Finding code to copy.

**26/10/25** - Got the code, rewriting it to fit our test case.

**26/10/25** - I quit, I took the flag with me, btw.


## Reason to why I quit:
1. He didn't pay me on time
2. He ghosted me for 3 months
3. He said i wasn't getting paid cash but "exposure"
4. He said uhhh it's not you, it's me
5. HNF isn't real.
